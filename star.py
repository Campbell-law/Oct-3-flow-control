# Star Patterns
# This involves nested loops the idea is to print a pattern like this:
#  *
#  **
#  ***
#  ****
#  *****
#  ******
#  *******
#  ********
#  *********
#  **********

# A few Hints
# 1. Use ranges 10 rows for x in range(1,11) remember it will stop at 10
# 2. Try a second range for each row - a nested range:
# 3. It should look something like this:
#    for x in range(1,11):  
#        for y in range(1,...):  Think about the end of the range an dhow it relates to the row
#           print("*", end="")  The end="" prints the * on one line
#        print()  you might want to jump to the next line after each line

# Now try something similar for this pattern
