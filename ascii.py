# ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
# ASCII code is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.
# The text on your computer screen is actually represented as a number 
# that is converted to a character on your screen
# There are 255 ASCII Characters represented by the number 1 - 255
# Hint you can use chr(number) to get the ASCII equivalent of a number 
# ie chr(65) returns A
# you will need to loop through the range of numbers from  from 1  to 255
# your output should look something like:  65 = A
